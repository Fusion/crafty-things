# Crafty Things

A basic extension for Craft.do. Install the extension, and as long as you have Things installed, clicking "Link in Things" will copy the unchecked tasks from the current page to Things 3. Links to both applications will be included.

I am quite likely to refine the feature set in the future.

# Installing

First, import the extension in Craft. Since the CraftX API does not interact with other apps, you will have to run a lightweight service. Said service can be installed, for now, using `make install`
